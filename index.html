    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>My name is Adam and this website was created by me to showcase some of my work as well as serving as a place to learn and experiment with web design. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, but I also want to develop my image editing and web design skills as I have a passion for digital design. Other than the awesome parallax scrolling effect, I haven't gotten to adding much else so this wesbite is a work in progress.</p>
