      <p>
        Although I'm more used to Java, I enjoy using C++ as it shares many similarities with it. However, I do miss garbage collection sometimes. I usually
        use C++ when working on console applications/ASCII art, and the speed is hard to beat.<br> <br> <br>

        <b><a href="https://github.com/venomz75/fractalASCII">fractalASCII</a></b> <br>
        fractalASCII is a collection of ASCII art fractal generators. So far I've only finished one fractal, but I'd like to add more soon.<br> <br>

        <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle">Sierpinski Triangle</a></u> <br>
        The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal in the shape of an triangle, further divided into smaller triangles. Here's how my version works:
        <ol>
          <li>Input the desired number of iterations <i>n</i>.</li>
          <li>Creates a triangle of height <i>2<sup>n</sup></i></li>
          <li>The central triangle is removed after dividing the triangle into 4.</li>
          <li>Step 3 is now carried out on the other congruent triangles, resulting in more triangles with half the height.</li>
          <li>Step 4 is repeated recursively until further iterations would create triangles of a height lower than 2.</li>
        </ol>

        Playing with fractals have been a very enjoyable experience so I look forward to working with them more.
