      <p>
        I've used Node.js to host web applications on a Raspberry Pi, which keeps cost and power usage to a minimum. Usually they take the form of bot users for programs like Discord or Steam.<br> <br> <br>
        <b><a href="https://github.com/venomz75/nadeBot">nadeBot</a></b> <br>
        nadeBot was my first Discord bot which had a purpose in mind as opposed to being made for testing. It is a utility bot for CS:GO, namely for grenade lineups one can use to smoke off key areas of a map during competitive play. <br>
        It was designed to be operated by a "reaction menu" system to make it simpler to use than using text commands which a user may find difficult to remember. All the user needs to do is @mention the bot to begin. Then, the user adds reactions to the bot's post as an input. Below is the flow of interaction with the bot:
        <ol>
          <li>Pick a map.</li>
          <li>Pick a grenade.</li>
          <li>Pick a location.</li>
        </ol>
