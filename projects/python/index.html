      <h1>Python projects</h1>

      <p>
        While I am quite familiar with Python, there's only one personal project in which I chose Python over another language. This was due to the large amount of library support for the task at hand.<br> <br> <br>

        <b><a href="https://github.com/venomz75/papeScrape">papeScrape</a></b> <br>
        papeScrape is a web scraper for the notorious imageboard 4chan. The name comes from the term "pape" used on /wg/ (4chan's wallpaper board), short for "wallpaper". 
        The "scrape" part is self explanatory as it scrapes images from a thread of your choice. <br> <br>

        As I am into system customisation on both desktop and mobile platforms, I often download wallpapers to change the look and feel of my system. 
        It just so happens that 4chan's /wg/ board has a lot of good wallpapers being shared by other users.
        However, downloading an entire thread of good wallpapers can be tedious, so I finally had an excuse to try my hand at webscraping. <br> <br>
        
        It didn't take long for me to feature creep my simple project to have a multitude of unplanned features:
        <ul>
          <li>Choose ANY board, not just /wg/.</li>
          <li>Filter boards with NSFW content. Unfortunately /wg/ counts as NSFW as such content is permitted there.</li>
          <li>Choose any thread within your chosen board, and relax as the script does the rest.</li>
          <li>Multithreading support to allow for multiple concurrent downloads, further classifying this as a batch download tool.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="./img/papeScrape3.png" alt="papeScrape 3" style="width:661px;height:418px;"> <br> <br>
        The project was a success, and most of the features I wanted are in place. However, the controversial nature of the site the tool accesses does make me contemplate refactoring this tool for a more general purpose.
