        <!-- While I am quite familiar with Python, there's only one personal project in which I chose Python over another language. This was due to the large amount of library support for the task at hand.<br> <br> <br> -->

        <b><a href="https://github.com/venomz75/papeScrape" style="font-size:26px;">papeScrape</a></b> <br>
        papeScrape is a web scraper for downloading all the images in a thread on 4chan.org. The name derives from 'pape', which is slang for wallpaper.
        It has been recoded from the ground up, making it perform a lot faster in terms of loading content and UI interaction. It also features an image/reply count.
        This was made possible by scraping the catalog for a JSON object instead of going through pages 1-10 of a board. This among many other things slowed the old
        version of papeScrape down, limiting it's usefulness.
